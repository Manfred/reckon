Reckon
------

Reckon aims to make automated testing leaner. Reckon is very much experimental, you probably don't want to use it in production yet because the API is likely to change.

NOTE: If you're using any other test framework that defines the 'excepts' or 'rejects' method, you should load it before Reckon.
